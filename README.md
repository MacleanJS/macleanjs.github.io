# MacleanJS Developer Portfolio
This is my web-portfolio's repository page. On my portfolio, you can find information about me, my tech stack and discover projects I have worked on. 

#Purpose
The purpose of this portfolio is to show off my  developer skills and projects to all. I created this webpage to demonstrate my knowledge and capabilities in HTML and SCSS. 

#Process
With any good project, the most important step is a quality plan. For my portfolio I designed how my site would look and function through Figma's online web editor. Each day working on this portfolio I timeblocked sections and problems to tackle the task effectively and efficiently.
